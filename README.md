# Train Station Isochrone Data Analysis
A research on the accessibility of train stations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\
I'm still figuring out the best way to present this so will update my repo as I go along\
If you wanna run the all the files be sure to start with rapidkl_isochrones.ipynb \
You'll need an API key from https://openrouteservice.org/ it takes no time to apply. Just input the api key in the variable i created. \
The whole notebook was made using examples from openrouteservice. So check them out if you need to understand some of their calls and functionalities \
Appreciate any feedback. Feel free to reach out. \
