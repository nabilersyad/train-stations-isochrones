# Train Station Isochrone Data Analysis
This was a research on the accessibility of train stations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\
Sometime in February 2024, this project was cloned and recreated in a new repository at https://github.com/nabilersyad/train-stations-visualizer \
Moving forward this project will no longer be updated for the foreseable future and will only serve as a record of past work\
If you wanna run the all the files be sure to start with rapidkl_isochrones.ipynb \
You'll need an API key from https://openrouteservice.org/ it takes no time to apply. Just input the api key in the variable i created. \
The whole notebook was made using examples from openrouteservice. So check them out if you need to understand some of their calls and functionalities \
Appreciate any feedback. Feel free to reach out.
